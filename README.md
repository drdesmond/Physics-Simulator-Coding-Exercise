### **Folder Structure**

```

  components/      # UI components (Header, ControlPanel, ChartPanel)
  hooks/           # useSimulation custom hook

```

### **Simulation Flow**

- The simulation models the top pipe as pump-driven and the bottom pipe as a passive return:
- If the pump is ON (flow rate > 0), flow is as set by the user.
- If the pump is OFF (flow rate = 0), the simulation checks for passive return:
  - If the tank is above the panel (positive elevation difference), gravity-driven flow is enabled.
  - If the panel is hotter than the tank, thermosiphon flow is enabled.
  - Otherwise, flow is zero and heat transfer stops.

1. **Initialize Parameters:** Fluid, irradiance, efficiency, ambient temp, flow rate, tank volume, initial temp, panel area, **tank elevation difference**

## 🌡️ Physics & Formulas

### **Key Variables**

- **Irradiance (W/m²):** Solar power per unit area
- **Efficiency (0-1):** Base efficiency of the solar panel at reference temperature
- **Panel Area (m²):** Surface area of the solar collector
- **Ambient Temp (°K):** Outside temperature in Kelvin
- **Flow Rate (L/min):** Circulation rate of the fluid
- **Tank Volume (L):** Storage capacity
- **Initial Temp (°K):** Starting temperature in Kelvin
- **Fluid Properties:** Specific heat (J/kg·K), density (kg/m³)

### **Temperature-Dependent Properties**

#### **1. Air Properties**

All air properties are calculated based on the film temperature (average of panel and ambient temperatures):

```typescript
// Air density (kg/m³) using ideal gas law
ρ = P/(R*T)  // P = 101325 Pa, R = 287.05 J/(kg·K)

// Air viscosity (kg/(m·s)) using Sutherland's formula
μ = μ₀ * (T₀ + S)/(T + S) * (T/T₀)^1.5
// where S = 110.4K, T₀ = 273.15K, μ₀ = 1.716e-5 kg/(m·s)

// Air thermal conductivity (W/(m·K))
k = k₀ + slope * (T - 273.15)
// where k₀ = 0.0242 W/(m·K), slope = 7.7e-5 W/(m·K²)

// Prandtl number
Pr = 0.713 - 0.0001 * (T - 293.15)
```

#### **2. Solar Panel Properties**

Panel efficiency decreases with temperature and thermal mass scales with area:

```typescript
// Panel efficiency
η = η₀ * (1 + β * (T - T_ref))
// where β = -0.00222 °F⁻¹ (temperature coefficient)
// T_ref = 77°F (reference temperature)

// Panel thermal mass
panelMass = PANEL_MASS_PER_M2 * area
// where PANEL_MASS_PER_M2 = 10 kg/m²
// specific heat = 900 J/(kg·K) for aluminum/glass construction
```

### **Formulas Used**

#### **1. Mass Flow Rate**

```
flowRate_m3s = flowRate / 1000 / 60
massFlowRate = flowRate_m3s * density
```

#### **2. Heat Input from Sun**

```
Q = irradiance * η * area
// where η is temperature-dependent efficiency
```

#### **3. Heat Transfer Coefficient (h)**

```
// Using Churchill-Chu correlation for natural convection
Gr = (g * β * ΔT * L³) / ν²
Ra = Gr * Pr
Nu = 0.68 + (0.67 * Ra^0.25) / (1 + (0.492/Pr)^(9/16))^(4/9)
h = (Nu * k) / L + forced_convection
// where forced_convection = 5.7 + 3.8 * windSpeed
```

#### **4. Heat Loss to Environment**

```
Q_loss = h * area * (T_panel - T_ambient)
```

#### **5. Net Heat Input**

```
Q_net = Q - Q_loss
```

#### **6. Panel Temperature Change**

```
// Panel temperature change considers thermal mass
ΔT_panel = Q_net / (panelMass * panelSpecificHeat)
newPanelTemp = panelTemp + ΔT_panel
```

#### **7. Fluid Temperature Change in Panel**

```
ΔT_fluid = Q_net / (massFlowRate * fluidSpecificHeat)
panelOutletTemp = newPanelTemp + ΔT_fluid
```

#### **8. Energy Delivered to Tank**

```
Q_delivered = massFlowRate * specificHeat * (panelOutletTemp - tankTemp)
```

#### **9. Tank Temperature Update**

```
ΔT_tank = Q_delivered / (fluidMass * specificHeat)
newTankTemp = tankTemp + ΔT_tank
```

## ⏱️ Simulation Duration & Stopping

- The simulation will run indefinitely, updating the chart in real time, until you press **Pause** or **Reset**.
- There is currently no automatic stopping condition (such as a maximum time or temperature).
- For long simulations, consider pausing or resetting to conserve browser resources.

## 📝 Notes & Tips

- **Changing parameters:** You must press **Start** after changing parameters for the new values to take effect.
- **Flow rate:** Affects how quickly the tank heats up and the temperature difference between the panel and tank.
  - If set to zero, passive return is possible only if the tank is above the panel or the panel is hotter than the tank.
- **Try extreme values:** Set flow rate very low or high to see different system behaviors.
- **Chart:** Tank temperature, panel temperature, heat input, and heat loss are all plotted for insight.
- **Visualization:** The color gradient in the panel and tank changes from blue (cold) to red (hot) as temperature increases.
- **Panel Management:** The control panel automatically closes when simulation starts, and the visualization panel opens automatically.
